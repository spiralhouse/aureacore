# Release Process

The release process documentation for AureaCore is maintained in the project's GitHub Wiki.

Please refer to the [Release Process](https://github.com/spiralhouse/aureacore/wiki/Release-Process) page in the wiki for complete information about:

- Automated semantic versioning
- Manual release procedures
- Commit message guidelines
- Version numbering conventions

This allows us to maintain a single source of truth for project documentation while ensuring all contributors have access to the latest information.

> **Note**: If you're making changes to the release process, please update the wiki documentation rather than this file.
