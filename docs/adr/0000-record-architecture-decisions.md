# ADR 0000: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to:
1. Provide context for future team members and contributors
2. Document the rationale behind significant choices
3. Track the evolution of the system architecture
4. Enable informed revision of past decisions when circumstances change
5. Facilitate AI-assisted development by maintaining clear architectural records

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in the project. Each ADR will be:

### Format
1. Written in Markdown
2. Stored in `docs/adr/` directory
3. Named using the format `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` where:
   - NNNN is a sequential number starting at 0000
   - title-with-dashes is a brief, descriptive title

### Structure
Each ADR will include:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title prefixed with ADR number
2. **Status**: One of:
   - Proposed: Under discussion
   - Accepted: Approved and in effect
   - Deprecated: No longer in effect but kept for historical context
   - Superseded: Replaced by another ADR (reference the new ADR)
3. **Context**: Background information and drivers for the decision
4. **Decision**: The architectural decision and its details
5. **Consequences**: Impacts of the decision, both positive and negative
6. **References**: Related documents, ADRs, or external resources

### When to Write an ADR
Create a new ADR when making decisions that:
1. Have a significant architectural impact
2. Affect multiple components or teams
3. Involve technology choices
4. Change established patterns or practices
5. Have long-term implications for the project

### Process
1. Create a new branch for the ADR
2. Write the ADR following the template
3. Submit as a pull request for review
4. Incorporate feedback
5. Merge when consensus is reached
6. Update status as needed over time

### AI Assistance Considerations
When writing ADRs in an AI-assisted development context:
1. Clearly document assumptions and constraints
2. Include explicit rationale that can be referenced by AI tools
3. Maintain consistent formatting for better AI parsing
4. Link related decisions to help AI understand context
5. Document technical details that may not be in AI's training data

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Clear decision history for the project
2. Better onboarding for new team members
3. Easier architectural reviews
4. Improved AI-assisted development
5. Documented context for future changes

### Negative
1. Overhead of writing and maintaining ADRs
2. Potential for outdated ADRs if not maintained
3. Risk of over-documenting minor decisions

### Risks
1. **Mitigation: Documentation Drift**
   - Regular ADR reviews
   - Clear ownership of ADR maintenance
   - Version control integration

2. **Mitigation: Over/Under Documentation**
   - Clear criteria for what requires an ADR
   - Template to standardize detail level
   - Peer review process

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create this meta-ADR (0000)
2. Create ADR template
3. Document existing architectural decisions
4. Integrate ADR process into development workflow
5. Set up regular ADR reviews
