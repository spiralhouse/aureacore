# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document significant architectural decisions made during the development of AureaCore.

## ADR Index

Detailed ADRs have been moved to the [GitHub Wiki ADR section](https://github.com/spiralhouse/aureacore/wiki/Architecture-Decision-Records).

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR should include:

- **Title**: A descriptive title in the format "ADR-NNNN: Title"
- **Status**: One of: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Superseded, Amended
- **Context**: Background information and problem statement
- **Decision**: The decision made and rationale
- **Consequences**: Impact and trade-offs of the decision
- **References**: Related resources or ADRs
