# ADR 0002: Backend Programming Language Selection

## Status
Proposed

## Context
AureaCore needs to select a backend programming language that will:
1. Integrate well with the cloud-native ecosystem
2. Handle concurrent Git operations efficiently
3. Process YAML configurations reliably
4. Maintain consistency with other Spiral House projects where beneficial
5. Be maintainable and accessible to contributors
6. Have strong performance characteristics
7. Handle complex dependency graph computations efficiently

PhiCD, which AureaCore will integrate with, has chosen Rust as its implementation language. This creates an opportunity for consistency across Spiral House projects.

## Decision
We propose using **Rust** as the backend programming language for AureaCore for the following reasons:

### Technical Advantages
1. **Memory Safety & Concurrency**
   - Zero-cost abstractions for concurrent operations
   - Compile-time guarantees against data races
   - Ownership model prevents memory leaks
   - Ideal for long-running services handling multiple Git operations

2. **Performance**
   - Zero-cost abstractions
   - Predictable performance
   - Low memory footprint
   - Efficient CPU utilization
   - Excellent for graph computations and complex data structures

3. **Ecosystem**
   - Strong Git integration libraries (git2-rs)
   - Growing cloud-native tooling support
   - Excellent YAML processing libraries
   - Good GraphQL support (async-graphql)
   - Strong WebSocket support (tokio-tungstenite)

4. **Type System**
   - Rich type system for modeling complex domain logic
   - Pattern matching for robust error handling
   - Trait system for flexible abstractions
   - Generics for reusable components

### Strategic Advantages
1. **Consistency with PhiCD**
   - Shared code patterns possible
   - Consistent mental models across projects
   - Potential for shared libraries
   - Unified contributor experience

2. **AI Assistance**
   - Strong static typing helps AI tools provide better assistance
   - Clear error messages aid in AI-assisted debugging
   - Growing Rust support in AI coding tools

3. **Future Proofing**
   - Growing adoption in systems programming
   - Strong commitment to backward compatibility
   - Active development of async ecosystem
   - Increasing cloud-native adoption

### Alternative Considered: Go
While Go offers many advantages:
- Simpler learning curve
- Larger cloud-native ecosystem currently
- More widespread adoption in infrastructure tools
- Simpler deployment model

We believe Rust's advantages outweigh these benefits:
- Better consistency with PhiCD
- Stronger guarantees for concurrent operations
- More powerful type system for complex domain modeling
- Better performance characteristics
- Growing cloud-native adoption

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Consistency with PhiCD ecosystem
2. Superior memory safety guarantees
3. Excellent performance characteristics
4. Strong typing for complex domain modeling
5. Growing ecosystem support
6. Better AI-assisted development support through rich type system

### Negative
1. Steeper learning curve for contributors
2. Smaller (but growing) cloud-native ecosystem
3. Longer compilation times
4. Fewer developers familiar with the language
5. More complex deployment process than Go

### Risks
1. **Mitigation: Learning Curve**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation
   - Create coding guidelines
   - Offer mentorship programs
   - Leverage AI assistance for development

2. **Mitigation: Ecosystem Gaps**
   - Contribute to existing libraries
   - Create needed tools
   - Maintain compatibility layers where needed

3. **Mitigation: Deployment Complexity**
   - Automate build process
   - Provide clear deployment documentation
   - Use container-based deployment

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Foundation**
   - Set up Rust project structure
   - Define coding standards
   - Create initial documentation
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

2. **Phase 2: Core Libraries**
   - Implement Git integration
   - Create YAML processing
   - Set up GraphQL server
   - Establish WebSocket support

3. **Phase 3: Knowledge Sharing**
   - Create contributor guides
   - Document best practices
   - Set up mentorship program
   - Create example implementations
