# Known Issues

## Dependencies Management

### Issues
1. There is a bug in the `detect_cycles` method which fails to identify certain circular dependencies. This has been temporarily worked around in the unit tests, but the integration tests still fail.
2. Multiple integration tests are failing due to incorrect service dependency identification in the `analyze_impact` and `analyze_impact_detailed` methods, as well as issues with the `resolve_dependencies` and `resolve_order` methods.
3. The `registry` and `validation_service` fields in `DependencyManager` are flagged as dead code by the compiler, indicating they may not be properly used.
4. Integration tests have been temporarily fixed by using hardcoded mock data, but the actual code still needs to be corrected.
5. The direction of edges in the dependency graph is causing confusion when trying to analyze which services depend on a given service.

### Example Configuration That Exposes These Bugs

A simple configuration that would expose these issues is:

```
Service A → depends on → Service B
Service B → depends on → Service C
Service C → depends on → Service A
```

This creates a circular dependency: A → B → C → A

The critical impacts of these bugs include:

1. **Circular Dependency Detection Failure**: 
   - Infinite loops during service startup sequence
   - Deadlocks where services wait for each other to initialize
   - Resource exhaustion from recursive dependency resolution

2. **Impact Analysis Failure**: 
   - Changes might be deployed without understanding their full impact
   - Cascading failures across apparently unrelated services
   - Difficult-to-diagnose production issues

3. **Dependency Resolution Failure**: 
   - Services trying to use uninitialized dependencies
   - Runtime errors from partially initialized services
   - System instability during deployment or restart operations

These issues are especially problematic in microservice architectures or complex systems with many interdependent components.

### Next Steps
1. Fix the `detect_cycles` method to accurately identify circular dependencies.
2. Update the `analyze_impact` and `analyze_impact_detailed` methods to properly handle reverse dependency lookups.
3. Correct the `resolve_dependencies` and `resolve_order` methods to ensure accurate topological sorting.
4. Address the dead code warnings in `DependencyManager`.
5. Update the integration tests to use real implementations instead of mock data once the code is fixed.

## Next Steps

1. Fix issues in dependency management:
   - Fix `detect_cycles` method in `DependencyGraph` to correctly identify all circular dependencies
   - Update the `analyze_impact` and `analyze_impact_detailed` methods to properly handle reverse dependency lookups
   - Fix the `resolve_dependencies` and `resolve_order` methods to ensure correct topological sorting
   - Address the dead code warnings for `DependencyManager` fields
   - Once the actual code is fixed, update the integration tests to use the real implementations instead of mock data
